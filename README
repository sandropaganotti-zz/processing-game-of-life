This script is (another) port of the famous John Conway's Game of life, this time 
written using processing script language. 

Here's the instructions:
press 'p' at any time to pause the game, press again to resume;
press 'i' or 'd' to increase or decrease the speed of the game;
click on a square on the matrix to toggle its status (from black to white and vice versa), 
you better do that while the game is in pause in order to design your desired organism. 

My implementation is focused on keep as many logic as possible within a 'Spot' class which 
acts like a single organism.
